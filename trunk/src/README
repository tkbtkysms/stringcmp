3.How to write the input file(longitude(initial data)) 
Here, The variable is represented by small capital and number in longitudes. 
The inverse variable is represented by big capital and number in longitudes. 
example) The a1 of inverse is A1.

example)The longitude of set4 in test_sets.pdf 
The set of longitude 
A4 b5 c1
A4 a3 B5 c2 a2
a3 b4

We change the segments name like next example.

Before changing the seements name
a1 a2 a3 a4
b1 b2 b3 b4 b5
c1 c2 c3

After changing the seements name
1 3 5 7
9 11 13 15 17 19
21 23 25

Before changing the segments name for inverse
A1 A2 A3 A4
B1 B2 B3 B4 B5
C1 C2 C3

After changing the segments name for inverse
2 4 6 8
10 12 14 16 18 20
22 24 26

Thus each segments are odd number and the inverse of each segments is even number.
The inverse segment is corresponding to the segments + 1. 

So the longitude of set4 in test_sets.pdf is transform like next.
8 17 21 
8 5 18 23 3
5 15
